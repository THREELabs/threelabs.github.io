# ZeroDay: Cyber Security Simulation

## Overview
**ZeroDay** is an immersive, browser-based hacking simulation game where you step into the shoes of a white-hat hacker recruited by the mysterious "Zero." Your mission: dismantle "The Phantom Collective," a shadowy organization threatening global stability. 

Through **10 progressively challenging levels**, you will learn and apply real-world cybersecurity concepts—from network scanning and social engineering to exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities and neutralizing rogue AI.
